# Credit-card-fraud-using-DL-with-AGSS

This project implements a machine learning pipeline to detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data. It addresses class imbalance using various oversampling techniques and evaluates model performance with multiple metrics.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

Description: Contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, with anonymized features (V1 to V28), Amount, Time, and a binary Class (1 for fraud, 0 for normal).

ðŸ“Œ Features
Preprocessing:

Handles missing values.

Standardizes features using StandardScaler.

Imbalanced Learning:

Applies various oversampling techniques:

RandomOverSampler

SMOTE

ADASYN

BorderlineSMOTE

SVMSMOTE

KMeansSMOTE

Modeling:

Uses a basic feedforward neural network implemented in PyTorch.

Evaluation:

Computes Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.

ðŸ§  Technologies Used
Python

PyTorch

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

imbalanced-learn (imblearn)

ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone the repository or download the notebook.

Ensure you have the necessary libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn torch
Place the creditcard.csv dataset in the appropriate path (modify if needed in the notebook).

Run all cells in the notebook.

ðŸ“Š Results
The notebook compares the effectiveness of different oversampling techniques in detecting fraudulent transactions by evaluating the classification performance metrics.

âœ… indicates that the model was trained and evaluated using that technique.

ðŸ“Ž Notes
Be sure to run in a GPU-supported environment for faster training.

Dataset is highly imbalanced; direct training without oversampling leads to poor fraud detection.
